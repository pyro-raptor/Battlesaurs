***** Welcome to BATTLESAURS - TURN-BASED BATTLER *****

Relative to the Honors Project Contract, several changes and additions have been made to better the experience.

The following includes information that may help understand this program.
I RECOMMEND A PLAY THROUGH BEFORE FULLY READING.

Player is prompted with 3 character choices: Triceratops, Ankylosaurus, and Velociraptor.
Computer is given a random choice of the 3 above + 2 new dinosaurs: Tyrannosaurs Rex and Compsognathus "Compy" Pack.
Program will remain active until Player or Computer reach 0 HP. There will be no limit on turns.

** NOTE **
Each Dinosaur has been both buffed and "nerfed" to enhance gameplay according.
These are intended to be realistic. (If you could not tell thus far, I love dinosaurs).

** CONDITIONS **

Player will have 5 choices of actions, 4 for attacks and 1 for recovering respectively:
Charge, Stomp, Kick, Bite, and Rest.

DEFAULTS
Charge deals 15 flat dmg.
Stomp deals 5 flat dmg.
